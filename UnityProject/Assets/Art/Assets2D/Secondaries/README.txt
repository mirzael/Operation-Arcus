Purple
- Both Offensive + Defensive have the same sprite appear

Green
- For both offensive and defensive, I've provided 4 "frames" for a quick animation so that we don't have a static "pancake of death" as Pat has put it
- I've given you with and without the BG for the offensive attack, choose whichever you like
- For the defensive effect, it's still in 4 frames but in two parts. One sprite will go behind the Arcus model and the other above -- there are examples included

Orange
- Perhaps the most straightforward
